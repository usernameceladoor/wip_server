# Introduction to Computational Photography

## Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Glitch

There's a moment in every generative artist's journey when the accident becomes more interesting than the intention. For me, it happened on a Tuesday afternoon when a memory leak transformed a simple gradient into a cascade of impossible colors.

This wasn't failure. This was discovery.

## The Beautiful Error

Traditional photography captures light. Computational photography captures possibility. But what happens when we push beyond possibility into the realm of the impossible? When we deliberately court the glitch, the artifact, the error?

We find beauty.

Not the beauty of perfection, but the beauty of systems struggling at the edge of coherence. The beauty of mathematics trying to describe something beyond its vocabulary. The beauty of failure elevated to art.

## A New Aesthetic

In the early days of computer graphics, engineers worked tirelessly to eliminate artifacts. Anti-aliasing, error correction, perfect rendering - these were the holy grails. But what if the artifacts ARE the art?

What if the glitch is the glimpse?

This body of work explores that question. Each image is a collaboration between intention and accident, between control and chaos. The computer is not a tool but a partner, and its mistakes are not bugs but features.

## The Process

My process is simple: I create systems designed to fail in interesting ways. Buffer overflows become composition techniques. Memory leaks become color palettes. Race conditions become rhythm and movement.

The key is knowing when to stop debugging and start documenting.

## Why AVIF?

People often ask why I insist on AVIF format with its compression artifacts. The answer is simple: the artifacts are part of the work. Each image is not just the visible pixels but also the invisible mathematics of compression, the algorithms deciding what to keep and what to discard.

Even the file format is part of the aesthetic.

## An Invitation

This is not just documentation of my work. It's an invitation to see computation differently. To find beauty in the broken. To celebrate the glitch.

Welcome to the beautiful ruins of digital space.
