# Nucleation

A collection of single editions by celadoor. Images start as patterns of light written out in the panorama feature on the iPhone camera. These patterns and the movement of the camera form the seed that the image processor turns into a photograph.

## Methodology

These are screencaps from the iPhone. I took perhaps 1000 of them in late 2021 and early 2022 as I tried to explain what it was I was doing. In July of 2021 a conversation at Proof of People in London set in motion the concept for the Interlocutor project. And the need to reduce that to practice in order to create an instruction set forced me to confront the question -- what was I trying to create an instruction set for? 

## Conceptual Framework

Nucleation as a project was straightforward. Capture the patterns that appear on the iPhone screen as an image is being captured. Interlocutor was a challenge. The instruction set had to incorporate a limited number of steps and yet generate an interesting image without crashing the photo app in the iPhone. The entire process is built around moving the iPhone in ways that the product designers did not anticipate and over time it became apparent that interesting effects could be created though a limited reproducible number of steps. Nucleation served as a testing ground for this idea.
