# Decay - The Poster

SORRY ABOUT THE CREASES

The decision to make this poster crystalized around the idea of shipping a large format test print to multiple people, which led to concerns revolving around the costs of printing and shipping. The intent was not to make one archival print of an image - although I want to do that. Quantity is the goal, and it is reflected in the choice of materials (butcher paper) and the need to ship them folded (I am genuinely sorry for the creases).

I have been exploring aspects of printing for a few years, but the decision to move forward was challenging. Prior to 2021, my work manipulating the panorama feature of the iPhone was a private and well-insulated endeavor. Even when I started minting on Hic et Nunc I was able to manage the entire process myself. Print meant talking to people about the process and is, ultimately, a step into the traditional art market, a thing that I have actively avoided.

There is a comfort and familiarity in butcher paper; I still have concert posters from the 80ʼs on my walls, and fond memories of unfolding the posters that often arrived in the sleeves of vinyl records. Choosing butcher paper for this project makes it an ephemeral work which will age, possibly yellow, and crack.

The push to print is a recognition of the fact that work which revolves around pixel level detail and arbitrary rasters is not made for the small screens of social media, and these images often struggle with the fixed resolution of available commercial displays. The scale of this print is its most critical aspect, because it is large enough to have a substantial presence in a room. My hope is that you will embrace the moment this captures, and tack this print to your wall for a while,enjoying the emergent creatures and patterns in the image.

ABOUT CELADOOR

The exploration of hardware with the goal of bending it to another purpose is at the center of my life, both personally, and as a core point of interest in my career. The tradition of generative photography is built on a similar repurposing of hardware and processes. Over the last ten years, my personal work has coalesced around the iPhone, creating works which exploit the gaps between the assumptions made by the designers of the computational photography processing in the iPhoneʼs camera, and the actions of this one particular user.

THE PROCESS

My body of work is made up of images produced using multiple generations of iPhones, and effective manipulation of the panorama feature within the camera software. There are only 4 essential elements: A light source, the photo app, myself, and an interlocutor - an arbitrary object that sits in the light path partially occluding the lens. The goal is to crash the processing software, rendering it unable to ʻreadʼ the image data in the way it was intended.

Images are created by heavily controlling the path through which light gets to the camera lens by reflecting, refracting, or transmitting through the Interlocutor. Over the years I have used my fingers, money, credit card holograms, candy wrappers, the metallic closure of a sake bottle, water bottle labels, and whatever else has been at hand including the occasional bar napkin.

The process is haphazard and, to some degree, parasitic. I have made full use of an unaltered consumer device, following along with each new generation, and subsequent camera, and software developments with the goal of identifying and developing a reproducible process to generate the crashes or glitches that interest me.

DECAY SERIES

The Decay series is defined by shots with a specific glitch that yields intricate and disorderly groups of pixels, forming mottled patterns that occasionally fill the entire shot. This is my favorite output type. It has the capacity to generate the greatest number of surprising results, producing chaotic patterns which deposit pixelated blobs at different scales. At times, these look like they could be composed of tiny cubic bits of sand; grainy residue left behind by some core process that has been abandoned by the photo app.

As with most of my work, each shot is composed in a similar way: moving the iPhone and the interlocutor relative to the available light. The shots are taken with similar repeated patterns of movement, up and down and left and right, with occasional contortions as the pattern of light reframes the window of available movement within the panorama app. The unique outputs are created by subtle changes in that movement, and in the intensity and spectral composition of the light sources relative to the pigment of the interlocutor.

I have hundreds of images with outputs of single colors, or color blocked bars. Iʼm never quite sure what the result will be during the process, but the result is always fascinating.

THIS POSTER
This is an experiment in printing one of these photographs. The print is UV ink on butcher paper and is inherently ephemeral as the UV cured ink may outlast the non-archival paper. The print was made from a TIFF exported from Affinity Photo. The photo has been cropped to remove part of the image.
