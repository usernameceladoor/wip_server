# Costanza

All Costanzas are Costanzas. Some are grails. Others are also grails. Costanzas all flow from a common source image. There is no plan. There is no utility. There wonâ€™t be more than 64 unique Costanzas.

These were all made with Conjure (which shut down on June 10th). Most images went through at least two rounds of manipulation with a specific set of goals in mind. I noticed that more structured stage one images transformed into more well defined flowing stage two images. The thumbnail image needed to clearly evoke the source Costanza.

There will be a few non-canonical Costanzas. This all started because someone may have accidentally for some good reasons taken something a bit too seriously. It happens. So I am not being extra rigorous in my gate keeping.

Some collaboration with @aebrer is woven throughout this. More in spots. Less in other spots.

## Process

Conjure was an early Text to Image system. These images were created within conjure starting with a seed image of Costanza, which is a technical calibration tool used in media servers to test skin tone.
