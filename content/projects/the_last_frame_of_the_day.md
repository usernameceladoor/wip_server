The Last Frame of the Day: An exhibition of works to be viewed before falling asleep
Part of the first Ctrl + P Journal of Contemporary Art Biennale
Curated by James Clar

It turns out that there are few differences between my work, encouraging the panorama function of the iPhone to crash in interesting ways, and doomscrolling or whatever you do on the small sreen before bed. Most of the time I am consumed by the image on my screen to the degree that I cannot exactly reproduce my actions. Both consciously looking and lost in space. This collage evolved out of that work and the sequence of actions and recurring themes that create an image.

This is a LARGE file and will take a moment to load.
