# PANORAMA

The panorama as a shot and Panorama as a feature. This is what drew me in to manipulating the iphone. To take shots that I could comb for "landscapes". To take the movement of the phone and my control over the light entering the lens to build layered landscapes. This is the "pictures of moments that never happened and landscapes that donâ€™t exist" that I would talk about in 2021. 

This group of shots was part of an effort to move from the cropped images that made up the "four panel" series on Hic et Nunc to shots that could be presented as they came out of the camera without even requiring cropping.
