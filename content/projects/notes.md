# Notes

Brief thoughts, observations, and working ideas.

## Current Work

Exploring the intersection of computational aesthetics and information theory. The challenge is not merely technical implementation but conceptual clarity—how do we measure aesthetic experience in algorithmic terms?

### Key Questions

- Can algorithmic complexity correlate with aesthetic value?
- What role does observer interpretation play in computational art?
- Is there a threshold where information becomes noise?

## Recent Observations

The decay series continues to yield interesting results. The generative system produces variations that maintain structural coherence while introducing controlled entropy. This balance—between order and chaos, signal and noise—remains the central aesthetic question.

### Technical Notes

- Implementing cellular automata with custom rules
- Exploring reaction-diffusion systems for pattern generation  
- Testing threshold values for phase transitions
