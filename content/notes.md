## About Celadoor

Baked into every human creation are quirks and oddities that arise from the assumptions made by the humans who have created those things. Mass produced items are sometimes built on of incredibly robust systems designed to survive in the hands of â€œthe consumer", the hypothetical user that the designers of the product test against. This testing often allows for a consumer system to break in a far richer and more satisfying way than a professional device. 

My personal work is focused on the computational photography systems in the iPhone, creating work that exploits the gaps in the assumptions of the designers of the computational photography system. The tradition of generative photography is built on a similar repurposing of hardware and processes.

My work is created through the effective manipulation of the panorama feature within the camera software using multiple generations of iPhones. There are 4 essential elements: a light source, the photo app, myself and an interlocutor - an arbitrary object that sits in the light path partially occluding the lens. The goal is to crash the processing software forcing to generate a visually compelling image built around bad information.
